		<string name = "test_text"> If you add opposing constraints on a view, the constraint lines

		effect is most visible when the view size is set to or in which case the view is centered
		between the constraints. If you instead want the view to stretch its size to meet the
		constraints, switch the size to match constraints; or if you want to keep the current size
			but move the view so that it is not centered, adjust the constraint bias </string>
